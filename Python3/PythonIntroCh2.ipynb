    "## 2.2 Writing scripts\n",
    "Writing programs in Python to a file is VERY easy. Python programs are simply text documents - you can open them up in notepad, and have a look at them, just like that.\n",
    "In practice, however, you will use a so called __[Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)__ to develop your scripts.<br>\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll use the Jupyter Notebook interactive fields as an IDE. After the tutorial we'll use __[Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/)__ that comes with the __[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)__ Python distribution.<br>\n",

In an IDE there's always a screen where you can type the code with syntax highlighting (like here), a window where you can see the output and a button to run the script. The scripts are saved as `.py` files. These can be run from your command line - Open the terminal window, go to the folder and then type `Python mary.py`. Your program will now execute in the command line.<br>\n",
